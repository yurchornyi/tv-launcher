# Publishes a launcher release every TV updates itself to (Updater, config.xml update_url). A merge to main that
# changes the APK releases by itself (the next version, generic notes); this is for a chosen version or notes:
#   launcher/release.sh 1.8 "What changed"      (no version: the next one)
# The build happens on GitHub (.github/workflows/release.yml), from what is pushed to main, signed with the release
# key kept in the repository's secrets: no particular computer is needed, and nothing uncommitted here goes in.
# It bumps the version, builds, checks the signature, tags vX.Y and publishes tv-launcher.apk with update.json
# (the APK's SHA-256, which the TVs check). Needs the GitHub CLI signed in (gh auth login).
